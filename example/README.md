# About this demo

This example project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Its purpose is to showcase the custom hooks collected in the `/src/hooks` directory.

## It is all in the name of the package baby !

This demo is locally linked to the NPM package [@boostup/react-custom-hooks-collection](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@boostup/react-custom-hooks-collection).  The `/src/hooks` directory is used for the development of that NPM package itself.

Here is the [package README](https://github.com/boostup/react-custom-hooks-collection/blob/master/README.md) in case you want to check it out and contribute.
